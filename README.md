# odin-recipes
This my first project with html, I did it with the help of The Odin Project. It's about recipes. 

i started with this project on 21st august and finished on 23st of the same month. I learned about the basics of HTML but most importantly about Git and GitHub. I worked with this project on 2 different computers with the purpose of learning how to work with remote directories. All with help of Google and The Odin project. This is the first of many project I have in mind. I had some problems cloning and sharing repositories but I solved it with perseverance.
